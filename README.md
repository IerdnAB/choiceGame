This is a mini project which uses React hooks together with JavaScript logic and creates a mini game where the user shuffles between different cards in order to find the duplicates. Using only 6 cards the code then duplicates them and gives them unique identifiers which are used then to track if the selections match. If the selections match the cards will stay revelead and if they do not match they will flip back down. The turns are also counted and the new game functionality works and enables the user to start a new round.
